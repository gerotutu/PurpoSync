# PurpoSync
## Challenge
PurpoSync addresses the critical issue of inefficient and inequitable allocation within a multi-trillion-dollar global philanthropic market.

While a record $224 billion in Official Development Assistance was disbursed (OECD, 2023), global giving by high-net-worth individuals reached $190 billion  (Altrata, 2024), and $166 billion in private philanthropic funds on development (The Business Research, 2024), a staggering $3.9 trillion annual funding gap persists for the Sustainable Development Goals. 

This gap highlights the critical need for more effective methods of connecting changemakers with resources. Nonprofits in the meantime face:

- Donor Research Overload: They spend countless hours navigating fragmented databases, with limited success in identifying aligned funders.
- Lack of Data-Driven Insights: Traditional fundraising relies on intuition, often leading to misaligned partnerships.
- Limited Resources and Inequities: Smaller, grassroots organizations and those led by marginalized groups are disproportionately impacted, lacking the capacity to compete for funding in a system that favors well-connected and well-resourced entities. 

## The solution
